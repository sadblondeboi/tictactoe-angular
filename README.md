## Overview

My first app in Angular, made basically in two days. Maybe it doesn't look the best but I'm pretty proud of the functionalities (I didn't have that much time to finish it).
It uses JSON Server as a REST API and saves player objects with scores in local storage as well as in the DB. After refreshing the page you don't lose your score unless you delete data stored in browser. 

For services I used RXJS, so I could pass the data to child components and render it in a clear way in the browser. I also used router for navigation and I used SCSS.
